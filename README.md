### Subject / introduction
This project was created as a school project for the module 646-2 - 2022 - FIG / HES-SO Valais/Wallis by our group of students - class 607_3.

The application was created based on mockup provided by the product owner and Agile methodology was applied for the development of this application.

Visual Acuity Screening Tool is an application designed to perform vison test digitally.<br>
The goal of the project is performing visual acuity tests to children who live in Brazil.
The project come from the association Escolhares and our contact is Katia Steinfield.<br>
There is a main screen where a stimulus (a Landolt C) appears in a defined angle and position, and a second screen used as a controller to select the desired answer with four buttons.<br>
The results must be stored in a database and the application must have the possibility to run offline.
